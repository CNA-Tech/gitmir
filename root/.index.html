    <h1>Welcome to Gitmir Server </h1>
    <p>Gitmir is a lightweight github mirror intended to enable a user to git clone mirrored git repositories from this server, to enable git file downloads onto machines that do not have direct access to github.com</p>
    <p>Gitmir is not intended for web browsing. To use this server, from a git client, you can execute commands like "git clone {this_servers_FQDN}/{org_name}/{repo_name}" for any orgs/repos that this server is configured to mirror.<p/>
